Odin Recipes

This is an odin project task repo. 

The main goal of this project repo to learn to build websites using HTML/CSS and Javascript. 
While I have some experience in all three of these scripting languages in the past
I would like to refesh my memory. I would also like to hone my abilities and learn something new.

This repo will follow the development of a website that houses recipes for all kinds of foods.
