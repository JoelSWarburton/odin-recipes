    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This caprese salad features tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil drizzled with a sweet balsamic reduction and
        olive oil.
        Easy, impressive, and delicious! Most grocery stores now sell prepared balsamic reductions. Surprisingly it's
        just as good!</p>
